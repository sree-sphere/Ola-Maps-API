# Ola-Maps-API

Ola Maps was released this week, so I went ahead and tried this out.

Ola_maps: Geocoding with Autocomplete API

Ola_maps_reverse: Reverse Geocoding with Reverse Geocode API

Tip: If the map or output didn't load properly on streamlit, refresh and reload (R) are two options.
More: Not all locations are found because they built the map atop OpenStreetMap. So try a search engine like https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search/ and you will get the results.
